# Enabling/disabling tool for SSL/TLS
The tls.ps1 contains powershell script with functions that can manipulate SSL/TLS in win10 (and win7 probably). To use this config you need to change last lines on tls.ps1 to the functions you need. For _comfortable_ usage you can simply run run.bat to run the powershell script.
